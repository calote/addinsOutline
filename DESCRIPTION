Description: 'RStudio' allows to show and navigate for the outline of a 
    R Markdown file, but not for R Markdown projects with multiple 
    files. For this reason, i have developed several 'RStudio' addins capable 
    of show project outline. Each addin is specialized in showing projects 
    of different types: R Markdown project, 'bookdown' package project 
    and 'LaTeX' project. There is a configuration file that allows you 
    to customize additional searches.
